till now she discussed about how the customer segmentation is done . now i am going to explain using this customer segmentation 
information how the product recommendation is implemented

```
Problem Statement: In the context of our Retail business once the customer logs into Apro or Cqpro website 
to provide the personalized recommendations to the customer using the customer segmentation information.
```
```
API DEVELOPMENT
i have implemented the API using the springboot Framework which takes the customerId as the input and will return the top 10 highly purchased products in that segment
along with that also returning the segmentId or clusterId and segment category this segment category is nothing but we are naming the segments based on the revenue generated in that
segments we are naming the as high-valued segment ,medium-valued segment, low-valued segment.
```

```
Personalized Recommendations
in the Api Response i am returning the top 10 highly purchased products . these products can be used as the Recommendations to the customer
```

```
Providing API integration to multiple transactional systems
for example cosider the apro or cqpro website they are already showing some recommendations along with that they can integrate this api  and include the products that the api 
is returning along with the recommendations they are already showing  
```

```
for developing the Api i have used the springboot framework 
snowflake to store the customer Segmentation information here i can use the postgresdb also but in the training we learned the snowflake and our teams also 
uses the snowflake due to this i have used the snowflake as the database .

swagger for API documentation

## transactional systems.
here we can use this Api not only for product recommendations
in Aap we have multiple microservies running any service that want
the customer segmentation data they can use this.
for example there is a transaction happening using this api we
can identify that the customer is high-worth customer 
then this can also bring chance to provide extra discount.

## introduction
  * start with this: so far in Aap the Recommendation systems we are having
    are static  instead of doing that using the machine learning Methadologies
    customer segmentation is already done.we want to leverage the segmentation
    that has been done and improvise the recommendations in such a way that 
    you can bring more personalization to the recommendations per customer.
    At the same time it is an oppurtunity for you to expose the data to enterprise.
    

## Solution 
 * To provide the dynamic recommendations to Enterprise systems in Real Time
  I have developed An Api. Let me explain what is an API.
  In a nutshell we can say that 
  Api's Actually enables us to provide a way for other people so that they can use our applications or 
  they can communicate with it or they can exchange data. this functionality of the api is exposed via internet.
 The Api that i have developed will take the  customerId as a input and it will return the top ten 
 frequently bought items in the corresponding customer segment. Along with that it will also return
 the segemt category . here segment category means as previously supraja
 
* Product Recommendations: As i have already said in the Api response we are getting the top 10 frequently bought items
                         we can use this items as the recommendations to the customer.

* proving the api integration with multiple transactional systems: in Aap majority are transactional systems that is  multiple micro 
  services are running in Real time when a transaction is happening if you want to know
  what type the customer is and what are frequently brought items you can use this.

*Demo: Now i will do the demo 
      the demo is of two layers in the first one i will show how the actual api works 
      in the next one i will show by intergrating this api with one of the system.
